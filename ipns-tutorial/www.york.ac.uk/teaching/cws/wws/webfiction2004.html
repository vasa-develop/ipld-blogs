<B>Description</B>
<P CLASS="d">Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. . . . Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other. Donna Haraway, 1985</P>


<P CLASS="c">
Over the past decade the web and the rest of the internet have become well-used sites for information gathering and for communication. This literary and cultural studies module examines a third aspect of web-use, that of creativity, focussing particularly on writing on and about the web.</P> 

<P CLASS="c">Women have been at the forefront of  'seizing the tools' of the web in order to expand radical definitions of subjectivity, imagination, power and narrative. We will look at both paper and web-native online texts in order to:</P>

<UL>
<li>investigate the relationship between 'new' media technologies, writing, reading and theory
<li>assess changing definitions of literature and of fiction
<LI>develop transferable web literacy skills
<LI>generate a variety of salient feminist understandings of electronic fiction
<LI>have fun experimenting with digital writing
</UL>

<P CLASS="c">Our critical tools will be varied, drawing on existing feminist ideas within cultural and literary theory and on media-specific analysis of web writing as well as, of necessity, developing our own, perhaps tentative, perspectives. </P>

 <P CLASS="c">A willingness to take risks and a desire to engage with web technologies is more important than any prior knowledge, although existing literary, cultural or technical expertise is very welcome. This is, after all, <I>new</I> media and I am happy to work with a variety of starting skills, a range that will, undoubtedly, enhance the learning process for the entire group. Alongside reading texts we will also write texts, perhaps via the production of simple web pages or through collaborative, simultaneous online writing.</P>
 <P CLASS="c">While this module expects much of its students, full support will be given to help you develop the apposite skills. Within the remit of the course there is scope for students to develop particular trains of thought, and you will have some choice over the material we look at. A mutually supportive environment will be fostered via seminar participation and through the online class discussion list. You are encouraged to devise your own assignment in consultation with me, and this can be presented in traditional form or, if more appropriate, as a digital essay.</P>

<P CLASS="c">I realize that taking this course will be entering new territory for many, if not all, students. If you would like additional information to help you decide whether this course is for you, it may be a good idea to browse through last year's version of the option, <A HREF="webfiction.html"> available here</A>. I can also put you in touch with students who took the module in 2003, or answer any queries myself (email contact button at the top of the page, or send a note to Ann Kaloski at the Centre for Women's Studies).</P>

<P CLASS="c"> Further details of the module will be available online in autumn 2003.  </P>

<P CLASS="c">
