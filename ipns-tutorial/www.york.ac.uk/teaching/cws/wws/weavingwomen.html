<P CLASS="pink">key texts</P>

Alicia Felberbaum, 'Holes, Linings, Threads', 1998. <A HREF="http://www.aliciafelber.com/projects/holes/holesliningsthreads/index.htm" TARGET="_BLANK">http://www.aliciafelber.com/projects/holes/holesliningsthreads/index.htm</A></P>

 

<P>Sadie Plant, 'The Future Loom: Weaving Women and Cybernetics' in Mike Featherstone and Roger Burrows, eds <i>Cyberspace/Cyberbodies/Cyberpunk: Cultures of Technological Embodiment </I> 45-64. Sage, 1995</P>

<P>Felberbaum work was inspired by Plant's article, and she uses source material from the textile mills of Batley, Yorkshire in order to explore and expand Plant's theories. Taken together, the two works offer a history of computing that is part fact, part myth, and which places women firmly within the stories that a society tells about its culture. </P>

 

<P Class="pink">some ideas to start your thinking</P>
<BR>
<UL>

<LI>READING ONLINE. What was it like engaging with Holes-Linings-Threads? Was it like reading? Or browsing? Or viewing? Make some notes on <B>how</B> you read: what caught your imagination, and why? Where there parts that were hard to understand, and do you know why? How was it different from reading a print oral history text? What did you find out about the lives of the Batley women? What did you find out about artistic intent? 

<LI>ARGUMENT. What is 'Weaving Women' about? What are some of the key arguments? What do you make of them? Are Plant's ideas liberating for women? Is that an inappropriate question?

<LI>HISTORY. How is history presented in both the Plant and the Felberbaum? Focussing on specific 'historical' examples in both texts, consider alternative approaches.

<LI>THEORY, ART AND HISTORY. How did reading the Plant and the Felberbaum together help you understand each text?

<LI>MYTHS. Think about the new myths imagined by Plant and Felberbaum. Are new myths useful for women? Which women? Why now? Could you have a bash at developing a myth of your own ...?  
<BR>If this aspect interests you, think about myths in other key texts: <I> He, She and It </I> by Marge Piercy;  <I> The PowerBook</I> by Jeanette Winterson; 'The Cyborg Manifesto' by Donna Haraway as well as other feminist re-writings you have come across (try, for example, Amy Thompson's <I> Virtual Girl</I> or Piercy's <I> Woman on the Edge of Time</I>). 

</UL>
<P CLASS ="pink">class discussion</P>
<P>If you are facilitating this class session, feel free to use any of the ideas above to begin your investigation, although you may develop your own questions if something really grabs you.  Make sure you bring ideas to class which attempt to provoke discussion. What do you really want to discuss about these texts? </P>

<P CLASS="pink">secondary reading</P>

<P CLASS="m">Sadie Plant <I>Zeros and Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture</I> (Doubleday, 1997). Here Plant explores some of the ideas introduced in 'Weaving Women' in more depth. Beautifully written and highly recommended.</P>

"...Cyberflesh Girlmonster is a macabre comedy of monstrous femininity, of revenge, desire and violence...About 30 women donated body parts by scanning their chosen flesh and digitally recording sound. From these, conglomerate bodies were created, animated and made interactive..."<BR> Sadly, I haven't yet been able to get hold of a copy of this extraordinary CDROM, a work that inspired Plant.
