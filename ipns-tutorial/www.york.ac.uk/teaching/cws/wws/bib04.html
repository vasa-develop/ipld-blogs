<P> N Katherine Hayles, <I> Writing Machines</I> (MIT Press, 2002). A new book which expands theoretical understandings of literature by one of the foremost thinkers in the field of new media writing. Hayles uses pseudo-autobiography to take the reader through some of the problematics of reading new media texts, and advocates a 'material' literary theory. Marries design and text to offer a "zine for grownups". See also the very useful and imaginative web supplement on <A HREF="http://mitpress.mit.edu/http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/mediawork" TARGET="_BLANK"> http://mitpress.mit.edu/mediawork</A>.

<P> Mark Amerika, <i>Grammatron</I> (1997) on <A HREF="http://www.grammatron.com/" TARGET="_BLANK">www.grammatron.com </A> A classic and difficult piece that links narrative and theory. "A story about cyberspace, Cabala mysticism, digicash paracurrencies and the evolution of virtual sex ... GRAMMATRON depicts a near-future world where stories are no longer conceived for book production but are instead created for a more immersive networked-narrative environment that, taking place on the Net, calls into question how a narrative is composed, published and distributed in the age of digital dissemination." See what you make of it. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.trace.ntu.ac.uk/"  TARGET="_BLANK">Trace</A>. Based at Nottingham Trent University. Hard to know where to place this web site. In many ways it is the UK equivalent to the ELO (above) but last year changed from a kind of 'online art centre' into more of an 'art journal', with the consequent gains and losses of this more dedicated site. Lots of resources, though many are currently hard to find behind the journal format. Good articles, and you might like to follow <A HREF="http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/studio/pullinger/" TARGET="_BLANK">Kate Pullinger's journey</A> from print to web writer.
