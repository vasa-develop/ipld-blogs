 <H3> Marge Piercy<BR> <i>Body of Glass</I> :: <i>He She and It</I></H3>
<BR>
<P>We begin this option by reading a novel <I>about</I> the web. <i>Body of Glass</i> / <i>He 
She and It</i> was written just as the World Wide Web was being 
developed. The novel is ‘a good read’ and explores many ideas that are pertinent 
to this course. You might like to check out Piercy's website <A HREF="http://www.archer-books.com/Piercy/">www.archer-books.com/Piercy</A>.<P>

<UL>

Some questions to think about:<BR>
<LI>What are some of the powers of the web/ internet? 
<LI> How might the web affect subjectivity and identity?
<LI> What is the role of information in a web-saturated society? What 
  are the gains and what are the dangers of ‘the information highway’?<LI> How does sensuality, sexuality, affection feature in a techno-savvy 
  society?<LI> What kinds of hierarchies might web-technology facilitate? What 
  kinds of freedoms? What kinds of controls?
<LI> How is gender affected by the web - online and off? How is the 
  web affected by gender? 
<LI> What is a cyborg? What are the relationships between cyborgs 
  as a class and women as a class? 
<LI> What does the net ‘feel’ like?</LI>
</UL>
