<P> Throughout the course we may develop a simple web site as a critical group response to the issues raised by the module. There are many reasons for this, including:
<LI>the exercise offers a chance to learn and develop specific skills, in this case how to write web pages using basic HTML (web markup language). These pages can be very simple, or more complex, depending on the interests and skills of the group.</LI>
<LI>the pages will help you develop a critical awareness of the structures and theoretical assumptions of cyber writing.</LI>
<LI>working with web pages can be a good way to generate original connections between ideas.</LI>
<LI>much of academic writing is individual; with this group exercise you get a chance for collaborative work.</LI>
<LI>it's fun!</LI>
