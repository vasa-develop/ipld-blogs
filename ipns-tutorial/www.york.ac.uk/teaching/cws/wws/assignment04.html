 <H3>Assignment Workshop<BR>
&nbsp;</H3>
<BR>

 <P CLASS="pink">The aim of this workshop is:</P>
<UL>
<LI> to kick-start your thinking about your module assignment
<LI>to continue with the collaborative ethos of the module, offering each other support and ideas for the assignment
</UL></P>

<P CLASS="m">Please come to the session prepared to discuss your ideas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Devise an essay question. This will need to be negotiated with me, but when thinking of a question reflect on the scope of your assignment (how many words and how much time do you have?), the  remit of the course (how are you going to show that you have engaged with course materials and ideas?) and - very importantly - what provokes you about your chosen topic? (what ideas do you want to tease out and discuss as you write?). Read the list of <A HREF="assignmentideas.html"> essay suggestions</A> as a starter.
<LI>Consider what theoretical perspectives you might use, challenge, extend, and where you feel that in this <I>new</I> media you might be able to generate new angles and ideas, however tentative.  
<LI>Think about what technology you may need to help you answer the question: will your piece be online (or CDROM) or on paper, or a combination of both. As always, be cognizant of <I>why</I> you want to present paper or screen-read work. If using electronic media, begin to think about what further skills you need to acquire. </UL></P>

<P>A word about electronic media: don't be overwhelmed.  Quite simple text can be used very effectively - you don't need a 'flamboyant' site to make a valuable contribution to the field. In fact, as rule of thumb, I would advise you to use the minimum technology you need for your project. Concentrate on your words and your ideas, and let the technology (pencil, Word, HTML, hyperlinks, images) help you interrogate and present your ideas in the most effective way possible.
