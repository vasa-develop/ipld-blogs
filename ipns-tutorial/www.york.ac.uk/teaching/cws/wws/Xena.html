 <H3> XENA <BR>- with extras -</H3>
<BR>
<P>
For this week's work we go online. Having spent the past three weeks reading about different sorts of web experiences and engaging with different ways of writing 'the web'; and having dipped our virtual toes into MOO texts, now it's time to immerse ourselves in a piece of online writing.<P>
<P>I have chosen as the key text a site about the TV cult character Xena, Warrior Princess. The work is a doctoral dissertation about the 'Xenaverse' fan web sites. It is written and designed by Christine Boese who uses web-writing techniques to help her analyse online cultures.  Alongside (re)introducing you to Xena and her fans, Boese's pages offer a journey <I>into</I> theories that are useful for assessing electronic writing.</P>

<P>The work was first published in 1998, and although new media is a fast moving field, the thesis offers a moment when many of the techniques and the theories were transparent and your expedition will, I hope, offer you a particular, almost palpable engagement with theory. </P>

<P CLASS="medium">This week, I would like you to concentrate on reading/ viewing/ playing with/ visiting the Xenaverse site.

Bringing out your responses to this text:<BR>
<LI>Write down your first thoughts, however banal or confused - or even sophisticated!  Do you feel lost, excited, annoyed, bored, fascinated? ..?  Try to scrutinize your responses. How long did it take to begin to find your way around?  

<LI>Which links do you find yourself following? 

<LI>Does the site remind you of other texts, perhaps in a different medium?

<LI>Are you familiar with any of the theories from work in contemporary cultural or literary studies?

<LI>Write down your second, third thoughts...
</UL>
<UL>Pursuing ideas generated by the site:

<LI>READING: If you would like to think about media-specific reading <A HREF="http://www2.parc.com/red/projects/xfr/xfr_guide.html" TARGET="_BLANK">Experiments in the Future of Reading</A> is a good place to start - it was an amazing project and art installation that questioned the way we read now as well as speculating, intelligently, as to what reading may become.

<LI>THEORIES OF WEB WRITING: see the 'theory' section in module <A HREF="bib.html">bibliography</A> and if you haven't done so already, make a start. Browse the Aarseth, Guertin, Hayles, Murray and Sheffield Sanford and begin your detailed study with the text you find most appealing. 

<LI>ONLINE COMMUNITIES: 
Nina Wakeford: <I>Networks of Desire: Gender, Sexuality and Computing Culture</I> Highly recommeded research on San Francisco net cultures, but unfortunately out of print, so use ILL. See also her article in </I> Web Studies</I> (David Gauntlett, ed) and <I>The Cybercultures Reader</I> (David Bell and Barbara Kennedy, eds).</P>

<LI>FAN SITES: these are innumerable, so start with your own passions and then try something obscure. Research a defined area - say, UK TV sitcoms, or punk rock sites. Or a popular celebrity such as David Beckham or the (now historic) Spice Girls.
