<P CLASS="pink">Purpose of module<P>
<P CLASS="medium">This option module offers a range of texts on and about web narratives and fiction. The course very deliberately builds up over the nine weeks and develops various conceptual and thematic connections between different texts. While this is true to some extent of all courses, it is particularly important for the way you should approach <I>Web Fiction.</I></P>

<P CLASS="pink">Managing the Course Reading</P>
<P CLASS="medium">Each week will feature one or two compulsory texts, while the reading list should be consulted throughout the course. This bibliography contains both <I>background</I> and <I>further</I> reading. Many of the texts are available in the JB Morrell Library or online, and I shall also leave books and articles in the Centre. You are strongly advised to spend time browsing print and electronic texts to enable you to evaluate the range of materials on offer. You are also encouraged to develop your research skills by searching for your own materials by following up references, perusing, and sharing useful information.  <P>
  
 

<P CLASS="pink">Facilitating Sessions</p>
<P CLASS="medium"> This is your module, and I want you to make the most of it. To this end, the module encourages a great deal of student input. Each of the weeks 4, 5 and 6  will be co-facilitated by about three students. This is a vital part of the course ethos.<BR> When you are facilitating, please
  frame your ideas in a manner designed to provoke discussion. You may, if you wish, use any of the questions I offer on the web page worksheets, otr you may devise your own questions, bring in material that makes useful connections with the key text or devise 
  a class exercise. This method can’t be overestimated – I am not expecting and do not want a coherent 'paper’ 
  but an attempt at opening up the key texts. <BR>

All this may sound a bit scary, but I hope you also find it exciting: you have the chance to direct discussion in a way that interests, or inspires, or puzzles you. Students are often quite apprehensive at first, but invariably find that this method helps them to understand the issues in some depth, and to participate fully in the module. <BR>
We will discuss this in more detail in week 3. In the meantime, as you browse the timetable, think about which of the sessions from week 4, 5 or 6 you would like to co-facilitate. 
Please liaise carefully with your co-facilitators to make the session as thought provoking and as useful as possible. </p>

 
<P CLASS="pink">Session Worksheets</P>
 <P CLASS="medium">These will vary each week, as appropriate for the topic. I will, as a rule, offer broad rather than tight guidelines for reading, and encourage you to create your own reading lists. As the module proceeds, you may wish to add your own worksheets to the web site.</P>

<P CLASS="pink">Online Discussion Group</P>
  <P CLASS="medium">Please sign up to this as soon as you can, and contact me if you have difficulties.  I hope that the discussion list will become a place where silly, exciting, off-the-cuff comments can be made and provocative as well as mundane questions asked. It's a place where we can discuss anything relevant to the course, in the broadest possible terms, and add resources and ideas to a class archive.<BR>
You can use it just like email, but you can also visit the discussion group website to read the archives and access stored files.</P> 


<P CLASS="pink">Web room</P>
<P CLASS="medium">Do use the Centre's web room. Students taking 'Web Fiction' have priority for using the room when they are doing module work. Spend time online, by yourself and with others from the group, and browse web resources as well as the book and magazine collection. Alongside the computers, printer and scanner, the room also has a fair collection of books about web fiction and culture, as well as books on HTML. You may read the books in the web room (there is a comfortable chair!) or borrow them for a week at a time so long as you sign them out. Please also use the notice boards - put notes up about useful websites or articles, or your latest idea! </P>
