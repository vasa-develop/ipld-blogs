Ada's method [...] was to weave daydreams into seemingly
authentic calculations. (Doris Langley Moore, in <A HREF="http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/love.htm" TARGET="_BLANK">Ada, Lady Lovelace</A>,

<P CLASS="medium">Linda Dement, Cyberflesh Girlmonster, 1995.<BR>
"...Cyberflesh Girlmonster is a macabre comedy of monstrous femininity, of revenge, desire and violence...About 30 women donated body parts by scanning their chosen flesh and digitally recording sound. From these, conglomerate bodies were created, animated and made interactive..."<BR> Sadly, I haven't yet been able to get hold of a copy of this extraordinary CDROM, a work that inspired Plant. But you can read about it in the interview with Miss M (details above) and on <A HREF="http://contactzones.cit.cornell.edu/artists/dement.html" TARGET="_BLANK">http://contactzones.cit.cornell.edu/artists/dement.html</A>. </P>

<P CLASS="medium">two works inspired by <I> Zeros and Ones</I> and 'Weaving Women' are:<BR>
Alicia Felberbaum, <A HREF="http://www.aliciafelber.com/projects/holes/holesliningsthreads/index.htm" TARGET="_BLANK"><I>Holes Linings Threads</I></A>. Felberbaum uses source material from the textile mills of Batley, in Yorkshire. A longer version of this, including work by other artists, is available on CDROM from me. <BR>
Helen Whitehead <A HREF="http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/www/" TARGET="_BLANK"><I>Web, Warp and Weft</I></A> for a different take on the issues, and lots of useful links to other creative explorations of women and weaving.</P>

Some ideas to think about:<BR>
<LI>Imagine <I>Zeros and Ones</I> is an unfinished manuscript. Write the next chapter. (Taken from www.educ.sfu.ca/gentech/cyberfem.html).

<LI> Write a footnote to any aspect of a course text. 

<LI>What is <I>Zeros and Ones</I> about? What are some of the key arguments? What do you make of them? Are Plants ideas liberating for women? Is that an inappropriate question?

<LI>How is history presented in <I>Zeros and Ones</I>? Focussing on specific 'historical' examples in the book, consider alternative approaches.


<LI> If you have read Donna Haraway's <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html" TARGET="_BLANK">Manifesto</A> think about the similarities and the differences between the perspectives offered by these two major texts.

<LI>Think specifically about the new myths imagined by both Plant and Haraway, as well as those in <I> He, She and It </I> and <I> The PowerBook</I> and  other feminist re-writings you have come across (try, for example, Thompson's <I> Virtual Girl</I> or Piercy's <I> Woman on the Edge of Time</I>). 
Are new myths useful for women? Which women? Why now? Could you have a bash at developing a myth of your own ...?
