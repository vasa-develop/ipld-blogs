<DIV ALIGN="justify"><FONT SIZE="-1">This page outlines the key texts that all of the group will be reading throughout the course. Please try to buy the editions suggested here, as it makes discussion in class so much easier if we are all working to the same page numbers. Books marked <B><FONT COLOR="8B4513">R</FONT></B> will be available on RESERVE in the JB Morrell library (borrowable for 4 hours at a time, or overnight, see library webpage). I have kept reserve texts to a minimum as reading to a tight schedule can take away a lot of the pleasure. However, if you take out a book from the ordinary collection that you know others want, please be generous and share. Nonetheless, it is expected that, where we use paper texts, you will buy the key book for each week (see timetable) to enable close and lively discussion in class. I have used a paperback edition where possible, and many of the books are available cheaply from local bookshops and from Amazon.co.uk. Books are ordered from Blackwell's University Bookshop, and list are kept on <A HREF="http://readinglists.co.uk/">http://readinglists.co.uk/</A>

<FONT COLOR="8B4513">I will not be providing an exhaustive bibliography for Hybrid Women, for reasons that I hope will become clear as the module proceeds. However, some texts will be added to this list throughout the course, and students will be encouraged to add annotated items - books and sites they find useful - during the course. Throughout the term I will also leave some books in the Centre for reading on the premises, or for short-term borrowing. </FONT>
