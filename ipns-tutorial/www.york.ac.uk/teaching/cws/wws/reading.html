 <H3>Reading<BR>Week</H3>
<BR>

 <P CLASS="pink">tasks for this week</P>
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
<UL>
There will be no taught session in week 2.

<LI>During the week, begin to find your way around the course both on this web site and by making a start on the reading. Use the bibliography link on the menu to the left, and read the guidelines for suggestions of how to approach the range of material on offer.

<LI>Think ahead, and make sure you copy or buy (as appropriate) any print  key texts needed in the first few weeks. (Plant's article for week 4;  Winterson's book for week 5). I will leave copies of <I>He, She and It</I> in Helen Webster's room for you to buy for &#163;6.
<LI>Browse this site, especially <A HREF="webfiction04.html">the first page</A>, guidelines, timetable and the first few week's worksheets. Get to know its structure. 
<LI>Think about which sessions you might like to facilitate (see the section about this on the <A HREF="guidelines04.html">guidelines</A> page.
<LI>Log on to the yahoo discussion list - see the link on the module  menu to the left. Post an introductory comment. This can be very broad; the discussion list is a space to chat about your concerns and interests around women, technology and writing. 
<LI>For next week: make sure you have read the chapter by Hayles, and have written a short piece about your own relationship with technology to bring to the session. Check out the worksheet for next week - see the menu on your left.
